# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** repository! This repository documents my journey through the Udemy course, where I successfully completed 100 days of intensive Python programming. Over the course of this challenge, I built a wide range of projects, sharpened my problem-solving skills, and gained a deep understanding of Python and its applications.

## About the Course
This course, created by Dr. Angela Yu, is a hands-on, project-based Python bootcamp designed to take students from beginner to advanced levels in Python programming. Over 100 days, I learned and applied Python concepts through a variety of projects, challenges, and exercises. The course covered a wide range of topics, including:

- Python Basics (Data Types, Control Flow, Functions, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Web Development with Flask
- Data Science and Analysis with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Automation and Scripting
- Game Development with Pygame
- Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Selenium
- APIs and RESTful Services
- Databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- And much more!
